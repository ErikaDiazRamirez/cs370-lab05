#In order to open my lab: 
- Download the zip file (this may take a while, I'm not sure if I missed adding something to my .gitignore).
- Unzip the file and go into the resulting file.
- Click on SideScrollerTemplate.uproject
- If prompted, rebuild missing modules.
- Once open, you should be able to just click on the green play arrow and you shoudl be able to get started.
